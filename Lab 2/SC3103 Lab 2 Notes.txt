SC3103 Lab 2 Notes

General Reminders:
1. Initialised hardware need to put in system.c
2. new c and h files need to include in system.h
3. need to create task in main.c

Practice A:

1. initialise button (button_Init)
2. declare song and notes as global vars
3. create button task function (similar to buzz task and led task in lab 1)
	- this is done by polling so need keep polling button
	- button = GPIO_ReadInputDataBit(BUTTON_PORT, BUTTON_PIN) in while loop


Practice B:
- basically need change led to be managed by freeRTOS sw timer service, dont need to manage timing manually
TIMERTASK = xTimerCreate("led_task", F2T(RATE_1_HZ), pdTRUE, 0, led_task);
F2T(RATE_1_HZ): specifiy timer period in tick periods - CHECK
pdTRUE: timer should auto-reload upon expiration
0 is the timer ID
led task is the call back function that freeRTOS will call when timer expires



if(xTimerStart(TIMERTASK,0) == pdPASS)
0 means high priority, function will return immediately if command queue is full
return pdPASS if start command sent to timer command queue successfully


Practice C:

1. Buad Rate declare in the init for uart
